Text identification and images finding
===
Find best images based on the article. 
This code borrows RAKE part from [Sujit Pal](http://sujitpal.blogspot.com/2013/03/implementing-rake-algorithm-with-nltk.html) and Google pictures download part from [Hardik Vasa](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download).

### Sample code
At the first, copy the link of article you want to use to search for the related images. Below an article on [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/sports/basketball/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-portland.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsports) was chosen as example.
```zsh
python find_image.py https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/sports/basketball/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-portland.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsports
```
